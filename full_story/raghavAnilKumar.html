              Today, he’s a filmmaker-cum-VFX artist with over a decade of
              experience producing high-quality video content for social media
              channels under the name ‘Shutter Authority.’ His channel has an
              audience of well over 3 million subscribers and he regularly
              collaborates with brands, famous singers, and actors on VFX
              projects.
            </p>
            <h2>The Journey Begins… With MS Paint</h2>
            <p class="first_text">
              While most kids spend considerable time watching movies, only some
              express a genuine interest in the creation process. Raghav was one
              of them. “Thankfully, the timing was perfect,” he quips, “because
              I was able to play with that stuff right at home!” Although his
              early attempts to recreate cool movie effects turned out crude, he
              still found it fun and rewarding.
            </p>
            <q
              >It was really thrilling for me to recreate cool movie effects!</q
            >
            <p class="first_text">
              As a kid, Raghav made drawings and crude animations using MS Paint
              on his dad’s Windows 95 PC. Interest in video editing came later
              when Raghav started experimenting with it on a Pentium 4 system.
              He quickly adds, “it used to be unbelievably slow!”
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              Raghav discovered VideoCopilot back in 2008 – a website that
              hosted detailed VFX tutorials for After Effects. It was the
              knowledge gained there that helped him develop a solid foundation
              in animation and VFX. Now, after over a decade in the field, he’s
              a well-known VFX artist who has worked with brands like Google,
              Electronic Arts, Nvidia, LG, and so many more on a professional
              level.
            </p>
            <h2>A Desire to Learn</h2>
            <p class="first_text">
              “Identify what interests you the most and research how you can
              learn more about it,” says Raghav. That’s his advice for anyone
              looking to get started in not just the VFX industry, but in any
              creative field out there. The availability of quality training
              material online, often for free, is a Godsend for those who
              genuinely want to learn. In addition to quality tutorials, Raghav
              also emphasizes the fact that both software and hardware are so
              much more accessible now. “Amazing software like Blender and
              DaVinci Resolve are free to use,” he exclaims, “and powerful
              computers are getting very affordable.”
            </p>
            <q>It’s never been this easy to get into VFX!</q>
            <p class="first_text">
              He truly believes that if someone’s willing to invest time to
              learn and experiment with VFX, it’s easy to start making inroads
              into this industry. Raghav’s primary focus today is his YouTube
              channel – Shutter Authority. He also collaborates with brands on
              exciting, and often cutting-edge VFX projects, “this forces me to
              keep learning new things,” he finishes.
            </p>
            <h2>Just a Typical Day</h2>
            <p class="first_text">
              A new project begins with writing a screenplay and developing a
              storyboard. Raghav adds, “we also make live action previews for
              better visualizations sometimes.” Next comes the camera work.
              Raghav’s toolkit for videos includes a Sony A6500 mirrorless
              camera, a Zhiyun Crane 3-Axis Gimbal or a Manfrotto tripod
              (depending on the project), DJI drones, and sliders.
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              Most action shots require the help of a Rokoko Motion Capture Suit
              – allowing Shutter Authority to produce animated characters much
              faster. Once all the video footage is ready, they’re sorted and a
              rough timeline is created in post. “I use Davinci Resolve for
              this, says Raghav.
            </p>
            <div class="col-12">

            </div>
            <p class="first_text">
              All VFX shots are motion/camera tracked in After Effects and the
              backgrounds are then exported to Blender. That’s where all the 3D
              work happens – a task requiring both precision and attention to
              detail.
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              Blender allows users to easily model/sculpt and texture 3D assets.
              These assets are then rigged with virtual bones of sorts
              (armatures) – an essential step in the animation process. Now, the
              models are ready to be animated.
            </p>
            <div class="col-12">
              <img
                src="../img/contact/RaghavAnilKumar3.jpg"
                alt="RaghavAnilKumar"
              />
            </div>
            <p class="first_text">
              The animations can be done either manually (a longer process) or
              with the help of a motion capture suit. “It depends on the
              requirements of a scene,” explains Raghav. For a scene that needs
              more realism and traditional humanoid movements, motion capture
              (mocap) is a faster, more accurate way to go about animating a
              model. However, there are times when you’ll want to create an
              animation from scratch. For example, when you want to deviate from
              realism and get more creative with a character.
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              Raghav continues, “the next step is to light the scene and render
              CGI passes.” The rendered CG layers are all then composited in
              After Effects over the live-action plates – integrating it to make
              it seamless.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="first_text">
              The final composition is then rendered and exported to Davinci
              Resolve to go through the final edit, color grading, and sound
              mixing. Quite a day.

            <h2>Powerful Hardware and VFX – A Perfect Match</h2>
            <p class="first_text">
              Coming from trying to edit videos on a Pentium 4 machine, Raghav
              is one of those people who truly appreciates the amount of
              computing power at our fingertips today.
            </p>
            <q
              >Right now seems like the golden age of digital storytelling
              thanks to the amazing software and hardware we have today!</q
            >
            <p class="first_text">
              The processing power needed from both a compute and graphics
              standpoint to handle a professional VFX workflow is mind-boggling.
              Juggling Blender, Adobe After Effects, EmberGen, and Davinci
              Resolve, to create a polished piece of work is no mean feat. “I’m
              always on the lookout for something that will significantly
              improve my VFX workflow,” says Raghav.
            </p>
            <div class="col-12">
              <img

            </div>
            <p class="first_text">
              When it comes to computer hardware, Raghav’s used it all. From
              Intel’s early Pentium CPUs to AMD Radeon 5000 graphics, he’s seen
              a marked improvement to his workflow with each passing year.
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              While many professionals aren’t too sure how to go about speeding
              up their work, Raghav is among those who know. His choice of the
              MSI RTX 3090 SUPRIM is simple he says, “considering most of the
              applications in my workflow are GPU-accelerated, the MSI RTX 3090
              SUPRIM with 24 Gigabytes of VRAM seemed like the perfect choice.”
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              When working with slower hardware, professionals like Raghav have
              to deal with issues like a lack of responsiveness and protracted
              project timelines.
            </p>
            <q
              >Earlier, making even a basic low-poly character would take
              several days, and animating it felt like a huge accomplishment.</q
            >
            <p class="first_text">
              Working on a powerful PC that houses parts specifically designed
              to handle high-performance workloads like VFX and CG is a dream
              come true. “It’s been an absolute pleasure working on a PC built
              around the MSI MEG Z490 Unify motherboard and an MSI RTX 3090
              SUPRIM X 24G graphics card,” exclaims Raghav.
            </p>
            <div class="col-12">
              <img

            </div>
            <q>It’s handled everything I’ve thrown at it quite easily.</q>
            <p class="first_text">
              While the motherboard offers excellent upgrade potential thanks to
              its extensibility, “the graphics card is the real beast,” he
              grins. When it comes to rendering on 3D software in his workflow,
              it’s over 2 times faster than the Titan RTX he was using just over
              a year ago! Not only does this allow him to render animations in
              half the time, but he can also opt to render at a higher quality.
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              Raghav believes we’re heading towards GPU-accelerated workloads
              for almost every kind of task in his workflow – making the GPU one
              of the most important parts you can buy for a VFX workstation.
            </p>
            <q

            <h2>As far as the Eyes Can See – Monitors, HDR, and More</h2>
            <p class="first_text">
              For professionals like Raghav who will always need more than one
              application running at the same time, dual monitors are a Godsend.
              “One large monitor would still make it hard to keep all the open
              windows organized,” he explains, “it’s really important to have
              enough display real-estate to manage all applications more
              effectively.”
            </p>
            <div class="col-12">
              <img
                src="../img/contact/RaghavAnilKumar7.jpg"
                alt="RaghavAnilKumar"
              />
            </div>
            <p class="first_text">
              Another crucial factor when picking a monitor for professional use
              is its color accuracy. “The color precision on the MSI Creator
              PS321QR Monitor was excellent,” Raghav says. He also appreciates
              the fact that there’s a ton of control given to professionals –
              exactly what’s needed for a professional color-grading monitor.
              “This is especially true when working with HDR imagery,” he adds,
              “since HDR imagery holds a lot of detail in the brightest and
              darkest area of the image.”
            </p>
            <p class="first_text">
              A large 32-inch screen along with the 1440p resolution of the
              monitor allows Raghav to use and manage his software UIs more
              easily – further speeding up his workflow.
            </p>
            <q
              >It’s beautiful and I love it! The lighting on the back is
              gorgeous too.</q
            >
            <p class="first_text">
              When we’re talking about the looks and design for professional
              hardware, it should either slip into your workspace quietly or
              stand out and draw attention. For Raghav, the 32” Creator PS321QR
              Monitor offered the latter. “The metallic look makes it look very

            <p class="first_text">
              For Raghav, it’s all about looking ahead and wondering what’s
              next. He loves the progress PC hardware has made over his time in
              the VFX industry. “It allowed indie creators to do so much more,
              things that weren’t previously possible,” he says, “I’m excited to
              see where technology takes us!” The rapid progress in graphics and
              compute is a boon for creators like Raghav. It means more time
              creating, and less time cutting corners or waiting.
